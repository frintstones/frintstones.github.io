  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Welcome!</h3>

  <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition</a>.</p>
  
<p>
 My research focuses on the drivers of firm innovation strategy and entrepreneurship. 
 Specifically, I investigate how technological and institutional changes influence organizational dynamics, internationalization strategies, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem—including VC  financing and new firm creation.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I have been investigating how generative AI affects startup growth and founding team diversity. 
  You can find more details in the <a href="./research">research</a> section and on my <a href="./cv">CV</a>.
