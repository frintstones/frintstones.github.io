### Welcome!

I am **Namil Kim**, an associate professor at the [School of Management](https://som.hit.edu.cn/en/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.hit.edu.cn). 


- My research interests broadly lie in innovation and entrepreneurship. 
  - I have conducted studies on industry dynamics, firm's innovation performance, and influence of socio-economic factors on entrepreurial activities.
  - Recently, I am also interested in the economics of digitiztion and AI. 
  - Specifically some of my current working projects discuss how digitization and AI changes decision-making, knowledge discovery, collaborative works, group discussions and new product usages.

<!-- If you 

 financial market quality and portfolio allocation.

In one of my projects, I theoretically document and provide supportive empirical evidence for a novel driver of passive investing: falling costs to fundamental information. In other ongoing work, I study the implications of quantitative mutual funds and exchange traded products to market quality.



The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments.
I explore three different types of competition and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
Product market competition
Competition for labor forces, and
Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights
