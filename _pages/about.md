  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Welcome!</h3>

  <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition</a>.</p>
  
  <p> My research examines the causes and consequences of entrepreneurial strategies, with a particular focus on how technological innovation and public policies influence startup entry, team formation, venture capital investment, and inventor mobility. To study this, I draw on empirical contexts such as the emergence of new digital platforms, advances in artificial intelligence, and the enactment of public policies including Paid Family Leave, Right-to-Work laws, the American Inventors Protection Act, and the German Accelerator Program.</p>
  
  <p>You can find more details in the <a href="./research">research</a> section and on my <a href="./cv">CV</a>.</p>
