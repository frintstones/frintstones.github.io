  <h3>Welcome!</h3>

  <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the
  <a href="https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition</a>.</p>

  <p>My research examines what drives the entry and growth of startups, with a particular
  focus on technological innovation and institutional factors, such as employment and
  innovation policies.</p>

  <p>On the technology side, I study entrepreneurial activity amid rapid advances in digital
  platforms and AI. I also analyze startupsâ€™ technological space using large language
  models to examine links to venture funding outcomes.</p>

  <p>On the institutional side, I examine how contexts shape entrepreneurial entry and growth,
  drawing on settings such as Paid Family Leave policies, Right-to-Work laws, the American
  Inventors Protection Act, and the German Accelerator Program.</p>

  <p>You can find more details in the <a href="./research">research</a> section and on my <a href="./cv">CV</a>.</p>
