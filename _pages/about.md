  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Welcome!</h3>

  <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <p> My research centers on entrepreneurship and firmsâ€™ innovation strategies, examining how technological innovation and public policies shape startup entry, venture capital investment, and inventor mobility. To study this, I draw on empirical contexts such as the emergence of new digital platforms, advances in artificial intelligence, and the enactment of public policies including Paid Family Leave, Right-to-Work laws, the American Inventors Protection Act, and the German Accelerator Program.</p>
