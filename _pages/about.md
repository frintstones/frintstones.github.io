Welcome to my personal page! I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/).

- <b>My research examines what drives the entry and growth of startups, with a particular focus on technological innovation and institutional factors, such as employment and innovation policies.</b>.

  - <b>Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship</b>: This research stream examines entrepreneurial activity in the context of rapid advancements in digital platforms and the growing adoption of AI. I also analyze the technological space of startups using large language models to examine their relationship with venture capital funding outcomes.

  - <b>Institutional Factors and Entrepreneurship</b>: Another focus of my research is on how institutional contexts influence entrepreneurial entry and startup growth. I explore these dynamics using empirical settings like Paid Family Leave policies, Right-to-Work laws, the American Inventors Protection Act, and the German Accelerator Program.

 financial market quality and portfolio allocation.

In one of my projects, I theoretically document and provide supportive empirical evidence for a novel driver of passive investing: falling costs to fundamental information. In other ongoing work, I study the implications of quantitative mutual funds and exchange traded products to market quality.



The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments.
I explore three different types of competition and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
Product market competition
Competition for labor forces, and
Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights
