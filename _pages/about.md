  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Welcome!</h3>

  <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition</a>.</p>
  
  <p> My research focuses on how technological and institutional changes shape firm strategy, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity. To address these questions, I draw on empirical settings such as the rise of digital platforms, advances in artificial intelligence, and major policy changes, including Paid Family Leave, Right-to-Work laws, the American Inventors Protection Act, and the German Accelerator Program, to causally identify their effects on startup entry, team formation, internationalization, venture capital investment, and inventor mobility.</p>
  
  <p>You can find more details in the <a href="./research">research</a> section and on my <a href="./cv">CV</a>.</p>
