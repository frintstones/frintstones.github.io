Welcome to my personal page! I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/).

- <b>My overarching research theme focuses on uncovering the key drivers of entry and growth in high-tech entrepreneurship, centered on technology development, business regulations, and public policies</b>.

  - <b>Technological Development and Entrepreneurship</b>: This research stream examines entrepreneurial activity in the context of rapid advancements in digital platforms and the growing adoption of AI. I also analyze startups' technological characteristics using large language models to explore their relationship with venture capital funding outcomes.

  - <b>Business Regulations, Policies, and Entrepreneurship (Inventor Mobility)</b>: Another pillar of my research focuses on how changes in business regulations and policies shape entrepreneurship and innovation. In this context, I have conducted empirical research on Paid Family Leave policies, Right-to-Work laws, the American Inventors Protection Act, and the German Accelerator Program.

In one of my projects, I theoretically document and provide supportive empirical evidence for a novel driver of passive investing: falling costs to fundamental information. In other ongoing work, I study the implications of quantitative mutual funds and exchange traded products to market quality.



The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments.
I explore three different types of competition and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
Product market competition
Competition for labor forces, and
Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights
