Welcome to my personal page! I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/).

- My research interests are focused on deepening the understanding of how technological advancements affect entrepreneurial process and start-up performance. 

  - One of my research streams is to demonstrate a new perspective for understanding entrepreneurial activity based on rapid advancements in digital platforms and the surge in the adoption of automation technology.

  - Another stream of my research focuses on how technological factors could be the competitive advantages of start-ups by looking at entrepreneursâ€™ behavioral responses to previous start-up failures.

I explore three different types of competition and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
Product market competition
Competition for labor forces, and
Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights
