  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Welcome!</h3>

  <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition</a>.</p>
  
<p>
  My research focuses on the <strong>drivers of firm innovation strategy and entrepreneurship</strong>. 
  Specifically, I investigate how <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>technological innovation</strong></span> and 
  <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>institutional changes</strong></span> influence inventor mobility, 
  firm patenting, organizational dynamics, internationalization, venture capital investment, and new firm creation.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I have been investigating the effects of <strong>generative AI</strong> on 
  startup founding teams and hiring processes. You can find more details in the 
  <a href="./research" style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;">research</a> section and on my 
  <a href="./cv" style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;">CV</a>.
