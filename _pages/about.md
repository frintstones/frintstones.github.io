  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;">Welcome!</h3>

  <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition</a>.</p>
  
<p>
  My research focuses on the <strong>drivers of firm innovation strategy and entrepreneurship</strong>. 
  Specifically, I investigate how technological innovation and institutional changes influence inventor mobility, 
  firm patenting, organizational dynamics, internationalization, venture capital investment, and new firm creation.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I have been investigating the effects of <strong>generative AI on startup founding teams and hiring processes</strong>. 
  You can find more details in the <a href="./research">research</a> section and on my <a href="./cv">CV</a>.
